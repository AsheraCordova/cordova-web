# Cordova Web

Cordova Web is an browser application library that allows for Cordova-based projects to be built for the browser Platform. It overrides the browser platform and combines browser and cordova android so that we can build ashera apps using gradle and teavm.

The goal of this library is that existing browser plugins developed should work with minimal changes.

To install the plugin use:

```
cordova platform add https://github.com/AsheraCordova/cordova-web.git
```
